#Accessibility Update and CSS Consolidation

##My assignment was an on the job ticket. I began with starter code that I modified to meet the the criteria of the client. The client has hired me to refactor the Horiseon website to make it more accessible. 


##The criteria for client satisfaction is:

#-Use of semantic HTML elements with loogical Structure independent of styling and positioning

#-alt attributes in place for images

#-Place a descriptive title
